# A platform to eliminate food waste by connecting volunteers to those with extra food.

This platform will have functionality based on the following user stories: 

As a food donor, I want to be able to post a pickup request, so that volunteers are notified to come bring my extra food to a shelter. 

As a FDC manager, I want to be able to view incoming deliveries, so that I can manage time more efficiently. 

As a FDC manager, I want to be able to set my hours and location on the app, so that donors know if my FDC is available for drop off. 

As a FDC manager, I want to be able to set delivery instructions, so that donors can meet with personnel quickly and easily. 

As a volunteer, I would like to be able to view pickup requests, so that I can determine the best pickup for my schedule on a given day.

As a volunteer, I would like to be able to set my weekly availability, location, and pickup radius so that I only receive requests relevant to me.

As a volunteer, I would like to be notified when a pickup is available within my set radius, so I don’t need to open the app and look frequently. 

As a volunteer, I would like to accept requests, so that I can communicate to donors that I am on the way.

As a volunteer, I would like to receive google map links (or eq.), so that I don’t have to fumble with directions en route. 

As a food insecure individual, I would like to view information relevant to my crisis, so that I can locate FDC’s and other resources.

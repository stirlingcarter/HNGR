# HNGR
# A platform to eliminate food waste by connecting volunteers to those with extra food.

## This platform focuses on 4 groups:

### Food Distribution Centers, or FDC's: 
-These are organizations that have registered to accept pickups. 
-They will not need incentives to join because the value is intrinsic.

### Donors: 
-These are organizations or individuals who have too much food (e.g. catered event surplus, etc.)
-One time donors will be incentivized by the fact that someone will come take their extra food off their hands, lifting a task from their busy schedule, as well as the charity of the decision. 
-Restaurants and regular donors will be incentivized by a certification outside their restaurant, similar to energy star certification for energy efficiency. 

### Volunteers: 
-These are individuals who are willing to pick up food within certain timeframes / radii and bring the food to FDC's. 
-They will be incentivized by a free meal, and a competitive program (see outdoor nation) that will especially encourage orgs like churches and schools to participate. 

### Food Insecure Individuals: 
-The application will also provide information and resources for those in need.

## This platform will have functionality based on the following user stories: 

As a food donor, I want to be able to post a pickup request, so that volunteers are notified to come bring my extra food to a shelter. 

As a FDC (food distribution center) manager, I want to be able to view incoming deliveries, so that I can manage time more efficiently. 

As a FDC manager, I want to be able to set my hours and location on the app, so that donors know if my FDC is available for drop off. 

As a FDC manager, I want to be able to set delivery instructions, so that donors can meet with personnel quickly and easily. 

As a volunteer, I would like to be able to view pickup requests, so that I can determine the best pickup for my schedule on a given day.

As a volunteer, I would like to be able to set my weekly availability, location, and pickup radius so that I only receive requests relevant to me.

As a volunteer, I would like to be notified when a pickup is available within my set radius, so I don’t need to open the app and look frequently. 

As a volunteer, I would like to accept requests, so that I can communicate to donors that I am on the way.

As a volunteer, I would like to receive google map links (or eq.), so that I don’t have to fumble with directions en route. 

As a food insecure individual, I would like to view information relevant to my crisis, so that I can locate FDC’s and other resources.
